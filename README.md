## ðŸ“œ About the Project

Create a single function using `Serverless` framework and integrate it with AWS, specifically `AWS Lambda Function`.

## ðŸ’¡ **[What is Serverless?](#What-is-serverless)**

Serverless computing is a method of providing backend services on an as-used basis. A serverless provider allows users to write and deploy code without the hassle of worrying about the underlying infrastructure. A company that gets backend services from a serverless vendor is charged based on their computation and do not have to reserve and pay for a fixed amount of bandwidth or number of servers, as the service is auto-scaling. Note that despite the name serverless, physical servers are still used but developers do not need to be aware of them. 

## ðŸ’¡ **[What is CDKTF?](#What-is-cdktf)**

Cloud Development Kit for Terraform (CDKTF) allows you to use familiar programming languages to define and provision infrastructure. This gives you access to the entire Terraform ecosystem without learning HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) and lets you leverage the power of your existing toolchain for testing, dependency management, etc.
We used `typescript` in this project.
